# cs1710 Final Project:: Kitchen Flow

A little about what we are modeling:

The team - Lauren, lilliana and Jacob - all worked at resturants dueing the COVID-19 pandemic. Now for out final project, we will be modeling a resturant to learn more about the complexities of the resturant kitchen flow! Given a normal sit-down-and-order restaurant that has different table sizes, a limited kitchen staff, and a menu of appetizers and main course meals, we want to model that using Forge. In modeling the kitchen flow, we want to see how appetizers and main meals come out for small vs. big groups. In our model, we will explore how different customer services strategies changes the sucess of the resturant. 

COMPONENTS: 

PERSON 
- Customer
- Chef
- Waiter

TABLES 
- Availability
- Orders [Dishes/Status: look into the array for] 
- Server
- Customers

KITCHEN
- Queue
- Chefs
- Orders [Dishes]
- Tables

Computer Science Models 

Kitchen Queue
- the first iteration of the kitchen queue will be a first in first out that takes in orders
- the second interation of the kitchen queue will be a priority based queue that takes in tables with different orders 
  
Questions from Tim: 

1. What tradeoffs did you make in choosing your representation? What else did you try that didnâ€™t work as well?

2. What assumptions did you make about scope? What are the limits of your model?

3. Did your goals change at all from your proposal? Did you realize anything you planned was unrealistic, or that anything you thought was unrealistic was doable?

4. How should we understand an instance of your model and what your visualization shows (whether custom or default)?
